# Rust State Machine

This repository features a simple state machine implementation in Rust that serves as a hands-on exploration of fundamental Rust and blockchain development concepts. Although influenced by the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk), [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate), and [FRAME](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame), it relies on no external libraries, providing an unfiltered look into the underlying architecture.

## Key Objectives
- Offer deeper insights into how frameworks like FRAME are structured and operate.
- Strengthen your understanding of state machine design and blockchain principles.
- Boost your confidence in leveraging the Polkadot SDK by showcasing the concepts at a lower level.

By walking through this repository, you’ll learn how various components fit together to create a robust, decentralized application foundation—one that serves as a stepping stone for more advanced development with Polkadot and Substrate.
